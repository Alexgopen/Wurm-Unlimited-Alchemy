*** BALANCING:

Consuming any potion results in a 5 minute cooldown, during which you can not consume a potion. (Toxicity :P)

Potion effect/duration is based on QL of the potion. QL basically equals spell power

A potion is the result of a complex order of steps and intermediate items. You can store all of them in bulk but you still have to make them.
Alchemical Compound uses an item that is a bit harder to come buy, but not impossible to find.

Potions have a natural difficulty. A potion of Healing will become accessible early but a potion of Strength will have a difficulty of 50 (making it impossible to craft at lower Alchemy levels, based on the QL of the used ingredients).

The process of making the potion uses different skills and only if all of them are raised enough (Foraging / Botanizing / Alchemy / Natural Substances) you can expect a high ql potion.
Overall QL is capped by Alchemy skill level.

The result is, that priests can get higher spell powers earlier and more frequently, while the alchemist needs a (RP) life of dedication and practice.
